In software control mode@@ values written in the GPIODATA register are transferred onto the GPIO port pins if the respective pins have been configured as outputs through the GPIO Direction (GPIODIR) register (see page 653). In order to write to GPIODATA@@ the corresponding bits in the mask@@ resulting from the address bus bits [9:2]@@ must be set. Otherwise@@ the bit values remain unchanged by the write. Similarly@@ the values read from this register are determined for each bit by the mask bit derived from the address used to access the data register@@ bits [9:2]. Bits that are set in the address mask cause the corresponding bits in GPIODATA to be read@@ and bits that are clear in the address mask cause the corresponding bits in GPIODATA to be read as 0@@ regardless of their value. A read from GPIODATA returns the last bit value written if the respective pins are configured as outputs@@ or it returns the value on the corresponding input pin when these are configured as inputs. All bits are cleared by a reset.">

Corresponding bits in the drive strength and slew rate control registers (GPIODR2R@@ GPIODR4R@@ GPIODR8R@@ and GPIOSLR) can be set to achieve the desired rise and fall times.

Writing 0x4C4F.434B to the GPIOLOCK register unlocks the GPIOCR register. Writing any other value to the GPIOLOCK register re-enables the locked state. Reading the GPIOLOCK register returns the lock status rather than the 32-bit value that was previously written.
