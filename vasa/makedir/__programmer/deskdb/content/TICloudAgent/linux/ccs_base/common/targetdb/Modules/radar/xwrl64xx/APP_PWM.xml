To be generated, the interrupt must be enabled (ETSEL[INT] = 1). If the interrupt status flag is set from a previous interrupt (ETFLG[INT] = 1) then no interrupt will be generated until the flag is cleared via the ETCLR[INT] bit. This allows for one interrupt to be pending while another is still being serviced. Once the interrupt is generated, the ETPS[INTCNT] bits will automatically be cleared. Writing a INTPRD value that is the same as the current counter value will trigger an interrupt if it is enabled and the status flag is clear. Writing a INTPRD value that is less than the current counter value will result in an undefined state. If a counter event occurs at the same instant as a new zero or non-zero INTPRD value is written, the counter is incremented. 0 Disable the interrupt event counter. No interrupt will be generated and ETFRC[INT] is ignored. 1h Generate an interrupt on the first event INTCNT = 01 (first event) 2h Generate interrupt on ETPS[INTCNT] = 1,0 (second event) 3h Generate interrupt on ETPS[INTCNT] = 1,1 (third event)" end="0" id="ETPS_INTPRD" rwaccess="RW" width="2"></bitfield>
