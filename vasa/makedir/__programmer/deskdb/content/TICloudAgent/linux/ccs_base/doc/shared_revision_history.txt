Shared Device Support Files
===========================

1.1.7 (Apr, 2020)
-----
Fixed CCDSK-3875: removed duplicate GEL files

1.1.6 (Fev, 2020)
-----
Added AM654x/DRA80xM Rev 2.0 device peripherals aligned with latest:
 - AM65x_DRA80xM_Maxwell_Public_TRM_vE
 - Split Rev 1.0 ICSS registers for RevA devices
 
1.1.5 (Jan, 2020)
-----
Updated AM65x/DRA80xM GEL files for PG2.0
  - AM65x Top Level GEL: can detect PG1 or PG2 chip to load proper PSC GEL
  - PG decision uses ROM date code. The ROM version (date code, commit ID, etc) is the only portion exposed after linux boot.
  - Updated WKUP_PID. This fixes address adjustments for PG2.0.
  - Fixed CLKIN function which was incorrectly using 4 bits instead of 3 to determine HFOSC0 frequency
  - Updated M4_PSC.gel with PG2 power domain and LPSC structure

1.1.4 (Nov, 2019)
-----
Updated AM65x/DRA80xM GEL files
  - Changed DQSCTL pull functions to just modify pull bits, keeping slew rate the same. This syncs with new EMIF tool which allows slew rate changes
  - Remove unused defines
  - Removed extraneous print statements
  - Further refinements for AddrMapCheck function
  - Added address map check to ensure address mapping in DDR configuration is correct
  - Added ECC RegDump Decode to M4_DDR_Init.gel

1.1.3 (Jul, 2019)
-----
Updated AM65x/DRA80xM GEL files
  - Fixed VTT_Regulator function with symbolic addresses instead of absolute addresses for registers
  - Added common Relock and Unlock funtions for CTRL module MMRs
  - Fixed VTT GPIO functionality
  - General cleanup
  - Added pointer to new function name for DDR_Initialization from old name DDR4_800MHz_Initialization_For_EVM()
  - Removed automatic DDR Init from R5 connect. DDR Init from R5 now has to be triggered manually from GEL scripts. A53 DDR Init with OnTargetConnect still implemented
  - Added dialog for unlocking registers
  - Added more info for Reg_Decode function
  - Added EyeMargin function

1.1.2 (Mar, 2019)
-----
Updated AM65x/DRA80xM GEL files

1.1.1 (Jan, 2019)
-----

   - Modules/am65x
   - emulation/boards/am65x
Added common startup files
   - startup_ARMCA8.S
   - startup_ARMCA9.S
   - startup_ARMCA53.S
Fixed CCSIDE-3476 (VFP initialization fails to complete)
Merged Spectrum Digital board and GEL files

1.1.0 (Abr, 2018)
-----
Duplicate OMAPL132/OMAPL138/C6748 register issues resolved

(duplicate [CCNT2, CCNT10, CCNT18] became [CCNT1, CCNT9, CCNT17])
 
1.0.5 (Dec, 2012)
-----
Fixed issue in OMAP3430 GEL

1.0.4 (Jul, 2012)
-----
Merged Modules files from C6000 and DaVinci directories
Converted from CR/LF (DOS) to LF (UNIX) on several files
Added cortexA8_util.gel and etm_cortexA8_registers.gel files
Missing dependencies for OMAP3 GEL files


1.0.3 (Mar, 2012)
