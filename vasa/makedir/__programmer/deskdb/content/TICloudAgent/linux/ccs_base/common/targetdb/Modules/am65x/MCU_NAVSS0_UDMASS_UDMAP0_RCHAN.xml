Available channel types are as follows: 0 = RESERVED 1 = RESERVED 2 = Channel performs packet oriented data transfers using pass by reference rings. Channels configured in this mode can only use Host and Monolithic descriptors and the pointers to those descriptors are passed from/to SW using rings in the Ring Accelerator. 3 = Channel performs packet oriented data transfers using pass by reference rings with single buffer packet mode enabled. Channels configured in this mode can only use Host descriptors and each descriptor will be processed as an independent packet (no buffer chaining). This is the only packet oriented mode that can be used with data sources that are infinite streams (no EOP) 4 - 9 = RESERVED 10 = Channel performs Third Party DMA control transfers using pass by reference rings. Channels configured in this mode can only use TR descriptors and the pointers to those descriptors are passed from/to SW using rings in the Ring Accelerator. 11 = Channel performs Third Party DMA control transfers using pass by value rings. Channels configured in this mode will directly pass individual Transfer Request/Transfer Response messages from/to SW using rings in the Ring Accelerator. 12 = Channel performs Third Party Block Copy DMA control transfers using pass by reference rings. Channels configured in this mode are linked to the same index Rx channel to form a bonded read/write channel 13 = Channel performs Third Party Block Copy DMA data transfers using pass by reference rings. Channels configured in this mode are linked to the same index Rx channel to form a bonded read/write channel 14 = Channel performs Third Party DMA data transfers using TRs provided via PSI-L (not supported in UDMA-P). 15 = Channel performs Third Party DMA data transfers using TRs provided via QDMA channel (not supported in UDMA-P)" range="" rwaccess="RW"/>
