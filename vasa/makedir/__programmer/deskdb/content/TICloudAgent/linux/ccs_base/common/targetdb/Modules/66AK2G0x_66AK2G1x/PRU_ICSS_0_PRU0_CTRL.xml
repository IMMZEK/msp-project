If this bit is de-asserted while the PRU is currently running and has completed the initial cycle of a multi-cycle instruction (LBxO,SBxO,SCAN, etc.), the current instruction will be allowed to complete before the PRU pauses execution. Otherwise, the PRU will halt immediately. Because of the unpredictability timing sensitivity of the instruction execution loop, this bit is not a reliable indication of whether or not the PRU is currently running. The pru_state bit should be consulted for an absolute indication of the run state of the core. When the PRU is halted, its internal state remains coherent therefore this bit can be reasserted without issuing a software reset and the PRU will resume processing exactly where it left off in the instruction stream." range="" rwaccess="RW"/>
