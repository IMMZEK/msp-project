For instance, if RDRATE is set to 4 cycles between reads, there are 3 inactive cycles between reads. RDRATE allows flexibility in transfer controller access requests to an endpoint. For an application, RDRATE can be manipulated to slow down the access rate, so that the endpoint may service requests from other masters during the inactive EDMA3TC cycles.
