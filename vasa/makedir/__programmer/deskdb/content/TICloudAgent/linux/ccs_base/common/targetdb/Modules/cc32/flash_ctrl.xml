The entries with a 1 are written on the next write of the Flash memory write buffer. This register is cleared after the write operation by hardware. A protection violation on the write operation also clears this status. Software can program the same 32 words to various Flash memory locations by setting the FWB[n] bits after they are cleared by the write operation. The next write operation then uses the same data as the previous one. In addition if a FWBn register change should not be written to Flash memory software can clear the corresponding FWB[n] bit to preserve the existing data when the next write operation occurs.">

Only FWBn registers that have been updated since the preceding buffered Flash memory write operation are written into the Flash memory so it is not necessary to write the entire bank of registers in order to write 1 or 2 words. The FWBn registers are written into the Flash memory with the FWB0 register corresponding to the address contained in FMA. FWB1 is written to the address FMA+0x4 etc. Note that only data bits that are 0 result in the Flash memory being modified. A data bit that is 1 leaves the content of the Flash memory bit at its previous value.">
