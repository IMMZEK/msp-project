For transmit operations through the DATA port, the Host should write to the same DATA port address to service all of the active transmit serializers upon each transmit data ready event. Similarly, for receive operations through the DATA port, the Host should read from the same RBUF DATA port address to service all of the active receive serializers upon each receive data ready event. To enable accesses from the Host to the McASP XRBUF registers through the DATA port, one must clear the XBUSEL/RBUSEL bits to 0 in the respective / registers in the MCASP_CFG Memory Map.">
