Transmission Error Interrupt Receive Buffer Overrun Interrupt Receive Buffer Full Interrupt Transmit Buffer Empty Interrupt Vectors for each of these interrupts will be reflected on the INTVECT1 bits, when they occur. Reading the vectors for the “Receive Buffer Overrun” &amp; “Receive Buffer Full” interrupts will automatically clear the respective flags in the SPIFLG register. On reading the INTVECT1 bits, the vector of the next highest priority interrupt (if any) will then be reflected on the INTVECT1 bits. If two or more interrupts occur simultaneously, the vector for the higest priority interrupt will be reflected on the INTVECT1 bits. Reading the Vector register when “Transmitter Empty” is indicated does not clear the TXINTFLG in SPIFLG register. Writing a new data to SPIDATx register clears the “Transmitter Empty” interrupt. 00000b no interrupt pending 10001b Error interrupt pending. Refer to LS Byte of SPIFLG to determine more details about the type of error. 10011b Pending interrupt is “Receive Buffer Overrun Interrupt” 10010b Pending interrupt is “Receive Buiffer Full Interrupt” 10100b Pending interrupt is “Transmit Buffer Empty Interrupt” All other bit combinations Reserved Note: Exception for clearing of RXINT If both SPIBUF and RXBUF (internal buffer) are full, then, reading TGINTVECT1 register (while it shows 10010) does not clear the RXINTFLG in SPIFLG register.

  <bitfield begin="0" description="“Transfer suspended” or “transfer finished” interrupt.(MibSPI Only) The SUSPEND1 flag is updated depending on the type of interrupt reflected by the VECTOR value field. 1 =The interrupt type is a “transfer suspended” interrupt. I.e. the transfer group referenced by INTVECT1 has asserted an interrupt, because the buffer to be transferred next is in “suspend to wait” mode. 0 =The interrupt type is a “transfer finished” interrupt. I.e. the buffer array referenced by INTVECT1 has asserted an interrupt, because all data from the whole transfer group has been transferred. Note: Special case for SUSPEND interrupt When there’s a “transfer suspended” interrupt(SUSPEND1 bit is set to ‘1’), reading the TGINTVECT1 register does not clear the “TG Suspended” interrupt. The SUSPEND condition should be resolved first before the interrupt can be cleared. This condition can be cleared by writing a new data to that TXRAM location and/or reading the data from that RXRAM location depending upon the SUSPEND criteria programmed in the “BUFMODE” field of that TXRAM location. The SUSPEND1 bit always returns value ‘0’ in SPI / Compatibility mode MibSPI. Even while there is an RXOVRN or any Error interrupt in Multibuffer mode, SUSPEND1 bit stays ‘0’. Refer to Section 6.2 on page 77 &amp; Section 6.3 on page 77 for more details and notes on better handling of interrupts. Note: Reading Error Vector Reading an Error Vector in the TGINTVECT1 register will NOT clear the Error flags in the SPIFLG register. The Error Flags in SPIFLG need to be write-cleared after servicing them suitably. If “TG Completed” interrupt occurs for a TG and after a while “TG Suspended” flag too gets set for the same TG, then the TGINTVECT1 register will show “TG Completed” interrupt giving it higher priority than the “TG Suspended” interrrupt." end="0" id="SUSPEND1" rwaccess="R" width="1"></bitfield>

For a full configuration of MibSPI, the 15th transfer group has no subsequent transfer group, i.e. no end address is inherently defined. Therefore LPEND has to be programmed to specify explicitly the end address of the 15th transfer group. Number of Transfer Groups implemented in a MibSPI can vary from one MibSPI to another since it is a generic parameter based implementation. If in a MibSPI, only 4 Transfer Groups are implemented, then the PEND of the 4th TG is defined by LPEND values defined in this LTGPEND register." end="8" id="LPEND" rwaccess="RW" width="8"></bitfield>
