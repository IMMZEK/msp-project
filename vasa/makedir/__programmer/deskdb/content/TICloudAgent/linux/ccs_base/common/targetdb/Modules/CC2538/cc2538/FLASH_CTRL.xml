If a write operation times out (because the FWDATA register is not written fast enough), the ABORT bit is not set even if the page is locked.
If a page erase and a write operation are started simultaneously, the ABORT bit reflects the status of the last write operation. For example, if the page is locked and the write times out, the ABORT bit is not set because only the write operation times out." id="ABORT" resetval="" >

Disabling the cache increases the power consumption and reduces performance. Prefetching improves performance at the expense of a potential increase in power consumption.

- 384/512Kbytes --&gt; All bits written and valid.

Writes to this register will be ignored when any of FCTL.WRITE and FCTL.ERASE is set.

FADDR should be written with byte addressable location of the Flash to be programmed.

Read back value always reflects a 32-bit aligned address. When the register is read back, the value that was written to FADDR gets right shift by 2 to indicate 32-bit aligned address. In other words lower 2 bits are discarded while reading back the register.

Out of range address results in roll over. There is no status signal generated by flash controller to indicate this. Firmware is responsible to managing the addresses correctly.
